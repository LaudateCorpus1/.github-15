# Fraunhofer AISEC

Welcome to the GitHub Pages of Fraunhofer AISEC 👋. We have two main categories of projects up and running on GitHub: Maintained open-source projects and archived paper artifacts.

## Maintained Open Source Projects

Our open-source projects, such as [Codyze](http://github.com/Fraunhofer-AISEC/codyze), [cpg](http://github.com/Fraunhofer-AISEC/cpg) and many others are regularly maintained by a group of people at Fraunhofer. However, please keep in mind, that in the end this is not a commercial software product, only open-source.

Also make sure to checkout out projects that we host on different GitHub organisations, mainly [Clouditor](http://github.com/clouditor/clouditor) and the [Trusted Connector](https://github.com/industrial-data-space/trusted-connector).

## Archived Artifacts for Research Papers

This category contains *unmaintained* pieces of software that we publish in addition to our research. Mostly high-profile venues recommend doing that and we are gladly following these guidelines. Please be aware, that these projects are mostly *point-in-time* artefacts, with their main use being to provide transparency into our research process.

## Looking for a Job?

We are always looking for poeple interested in open-source development. Please have a look at our [recruiting page](https://www.aisec.fraunhofer.de/de/jobs.html).
